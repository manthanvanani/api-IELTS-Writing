I agree that our current generation lacks these skills and to ensure that our future generation is strong with these must skills, we should start giving training from the school itself. This essay will assert few points justifying why speaking and presenting are very important skills for anybody to grow professionally.\nThe profession could be any like a manager in IT company or product company, politician, scientist at NASA, or a individual contributor in any project, in every day of professional life, you have to prepare a presentation and speak to your manager or supervisor to elaborate your ideas. If you lack in any of these skills, you will face problem in convincing people to follow your thoughts. It is very hard to become representative of company or a town or a country without having good communication skill.\nEven, these skills are so important that almost all employers conduct group discussions before hiring a candidate.\nThen, the important question is how to become expert with these skills? We learn many of our behaviours or skills either from parents or training institute. Without any doubt, parents are the initial teacher for any kids. Kids learn talking and good behaviors from parents. Once they are grown up and start going to school, responsibility partially shifts from parents to school as kids mingle with many other students in school and participate in many activities like speech competition, annual functions, exhibitions etc. So, the school should add special scheduled training to let students learn and practice presentation and speaking skills in public.\nTo conclude, speaking and presenting in public are essential skills for all to progress in professional life and school should give special attention to make their students far away from stage fear or presenting in public.",

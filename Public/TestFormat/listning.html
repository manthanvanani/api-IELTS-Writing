        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">There are two types of IELTS: Academic and General Training. IELTS Academic can be taken in a test centre on paper or on computer, and can now also be taken online from home or another private location that has a stable internet connection. IELTS General Training can only be taken in a test centre on paper or on computer.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">For Academic and General Training you take the same Listening and Speaking tests but different Reading and Writing tests. Make sure you prepare for the correct test type.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">The Listening, Reading and Writing sections of all IELTS tests are completed on the same day, with no breaks in between them.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">The Speaking test, however, may be scheduled up to a week before or after the other tests. If you booked IELTS Online, your Speaking test will usually take place before your other tests. The total test time is 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p>

          <strong>Paper format:</strong> There are four parts with ten questions each. The questions are designed so that the answers appear in the order they are heard in the audio.
        </p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">The first two parts deal with situations set in everyday social contexts. In Part 1, there is a conversation between two speakers (for example, a conversation about travel arrangements), and in Part 2, there is a monologue in (for example, a speech about local facilities). The final two parts deal with situations set in educational and training contexts. In Part 3, there is a conversation between two main speakers (for example, two university students in discussion, perhaps guided by a tutor), and in Part 4, there is a monologue on an academic subject.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">The recordings are heard only once. They include a range of accents, including British, Australian, New Zealand, American and Canadian.</p>

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">
          <strong>Answering:</strong> Test takers write their answers on the question paper as they listen and at the end of the test are given 10 minutes to transfer their answers to an answer sheet. Care should be taken when writing answers on the answer sheet as poor spelling and grammar are penalised.

          <strong>Task type and format:</strong> In multiple choice tasks, there is a question followed by three possible answers, or the beginning of a sentence followed by three possible ways to complete the sentence. Test takers are required to choose the one correct answer - A, B or C.
        </p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">Sometimes, test takers are given a longer list of possible answers and told that they have to choose more than one. In this case, they should read the question carefully to check how many answers are required.</p>

          <strong>Task focus:</strong> Multiple choice questions are used to test a wide range of skills. The test taker may be required to have a detailed understanding of specific points or an overall understanding of the main points of the listening text.

        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72">
          <strong>Task focus:</strong> Matching assesses the skill of listening for detail and whether a test taker can understand information given in a conversation on an everyday topic, such as the different types of hotel or guest house accommodation. It also assesses the ability to follow a conversation between two people. It may also be used to assess test takersâ€™ ability to recognise relationships and connections between facts in the listening text.
